---

## Design Principles

### 1. Architectural Precision
Every element is intentionally placed. Generous white space, precise alignment, and mathematical grid system create visual harmony.

**Rules:**
- 8px baseline grid for all spacing
- Consistent margins: 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px
- Elements align to invisible grid
- White space is a design element, not empty space

### 2. Monochromatic Foundation
Black, white, and grays form the core. Color is an accent, never the foundation. This creates timeless elegance.

**Rules:**
- 90% monochromatic (black/white/gray)
- 10% strategic accent colors (gold, emerald, etc.)
- Metallics for premium moments only
- Avoid color overload

### 3. Premium Depth
Subtle shadows, glass morphism, and layering create dimensional interfaces without visual noise.

**Rules:**
- Minimal shadow: 0-2px offset, 4% opacity
- Soft shadow: 0-4px offset, 8% opacity
- Strong shadow: 0-8px offset, 12% opacity
- Glass effect: 72% opacity with backdrop blur

### 4. Purposeful Motion
Animation enhances understanding and delight. Every motion serves a purpose.

**Rules:**
- Duration: 200-400ms for UI, 600-1200ms for delight
- Easing: Ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting
- Micro-interactions on touch/hover
- Never distract from content

### 5. Content First
UI should disappear, leaving content and functionality to shine.

**Rules:**
- Remove unnecessary chrome
- Edge-to-edge images when appropriate
- Generous padding around text
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 6. Gender-Neutral Excellence
Design that appeals universally through sophistication, not gendered aesthetics.

**Rules:**
- Avoid stereotypical pink/blue associations
- Use architectural, technical inspiration
- Professional tone with warmth
- Inclusive imagery and language
