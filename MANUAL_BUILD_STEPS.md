## 🚀 Quick Start

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/nandanreddyavanaganti/dubai01
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

## 📋 Answer These Prompts

When the build starts, you'll see these prompts. Answer them like this:

### Prompt 1: Encryption Compliance
```
? iOS app only uses standard/exempt encryption? › (Y/n)
```
**Answer**: Type `yes` and press Enter

### Prompt 2: Apple Account Login
```
? Do you want to log in to your Apple account? › (Y/n)
```
**Answer**: Type `no` and press Enter
*(This will use your existing credentials - your Apple account is locked, so we'll use the credentials you already have configured)*
